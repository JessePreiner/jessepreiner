============

For the mockups, i'm really digging the ones going down the left side. As far as the portfolio goes, I like the 3 side by side, then with the more, maybe it could overlay a picture of the screenie of the site, with just a simple close option.
I started to play around with foundations a bit, and did some reading. Now i'm getting a desire to play dota, so thats the way she goes.


To Do

2. **Grid up the site**
